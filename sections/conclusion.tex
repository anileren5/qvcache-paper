\section{Conclusion}

We introduced QVCache, a query-aware, backend-agnostic vector cache that achieves sub-millisecond cache-hit latencies independent of dataset size, while consuming only a memory footprint on the order of megabytes. By dynamically learning region-specific distance thresholds, QVCache delivers 40–1000× lower query latencies on cache hits compared to existing similarity search systems, without compromising recall. Across diverse datasets and backend vector databases, QVCache consistently accelerates query execution by converting queries into cache hits, demonstrating that adaptive similarity caching is a practical and effective optimization layer for large-scale vector search systems, particularly under workloads exhibiting temporal-semantic locality.
